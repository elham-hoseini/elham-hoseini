👋 Hey there! I’m Elham Hosieni, a Reactjs | Nextjs developer with a twist of AI magic! 🚀

🎓 Graduated in AI, I’ve got the brains for algorithms and the heart for beautiful web experiences. Whether it’s crafting pixel-perfect UIs or diving into neural networks, I thrive on turning ideas into code.

🌐 My journey began as a Full-Stack Software Developer in the .NET world. But then, like a curious cat chasing a laser pointer, I switched lanes. Now, I’m all about React.js and Next.js. JavaScript is my playground, and I’m swinging from hooks to promises!

🛠️ As a freelancer, I’ve built sleek React projects that dance gracefully across browsers. From responsive designs to efficient code, I’m all about making the web feel like home. 💅

🤖 And yes, I’ve got a secret weapon: AI. When I’m not wrangling divs, I’m whispering to neural nets. 🤫

🌟 Let’s connect! Feel free to explore my repos and drop a star or two. If you’re into code, coffee, or cosmic mysteries, we’ll get along just fine! ☕🌌
